This project is a simple text-based quiz game built using Python. It was created as a learning exercise to test my skills in the early stages of learning Python.

# Features:-
<br>1. Five questions with increasing prize money<br>2. Voice assistant-like experience using the `pyttsx3` library<br>3. Text-based interface for user input<br>4. Score tracking and announcement of total prize money won<br>5. Animated transitions between questions


# How to Play<br>
1. Run the game in a terminal or command prompt environment or any code editor/IDE.<br>2. Answer each question by typing your response and pressing enter.<br>3.The game will keep track of your score and announce the total prize money won at the end.


# Note

You have to install `pyttsx3` module as its not Builtin module. Also the `pyttsx3` library may not work as expected in some IDEs or online code editors. For the best experience, run the game in a terminal or command prompt environment.

 I hope you enjoy playing the game!
